This Python project aims to fit parameters for the GISA (Gaussian Iterative Stockholder Analysis) method based on computed pro-atomic densities obtained from the Hirshfeld-I method.
The pro-atomic densities were computed at the `PBE0/6-311+G (d,p)` level of theory, considering different states of the elements (cation, neutral atom, and anion).
The fitted parameters will optimize the exponents for a compact Gaussian s-type density basis set to accurately represent the associated pro-atomic densities.
